<h4>What is Archaeology</h4>
</div>
<p id="definition">Archaeology is the study of human history and prehistory by studying,analyzing,
  and recovering physical remains
and artifacts. it is considered a social science as well as a branch of the humanities.
while in North America it is considered a subfield of anthropology,
it is however considered in Europe a whole field of its own. this field is
often used to reconstruct what life was like during ceratin periods of time by examining artifacts,remains,
and historical writings</p>
<div class="">

</div>
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>Archaeology originated in 15th and 16th century Europe with the popularity of collecting and Humanism,
   which was a type of rational philosophy that held art in high esteem.
   The inquisitive elite of the Renaissance collected antiquities from ancient Greece and Rome, considering them pieces of art more
   than historical artifacts. They mainly did this due to the act that the elite wished to show
   off their wealth. It wasn't until much later in the 17th and 18th centuries after the
    Renaissance that people desired to learn more about the ancient world and their history.
    This is what would lead to a huge archaeological revolution that would cause people to  ask questions. Where did they
    come from? Who came before them? Where did they go and why did they leave? These were all questions that would have people
    thinking about the history of those who came before them.

<h4>History</h4>
<p>While it at first started as just art collecting to show off wealth, over time while people admired and collected these
  "works of art" they began to wonder where exactly it came from and who made it. This made the curiosity of people grow.
  It grew further when the Queen of Naples sponsored two archaeological excavations for the cities of Pompeii and
  Hercaleum, the two Roman cities famous for being destoyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. this was what really kickstarted '
  the archaeology revolution. it grew even futher when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt and brough back many artifacts. In 1822 Jean-Francois-Champollion
  deciphered the Rosetta Stone and let people read Egyptian heiroglyphics. It grew even more when people started to publish about works
  human evolution, such as the famous works of Charles Darwin who published "The Origin of Species" and the
  work of Lyell. People all over the world looked closer at what surrounded them. Stonehenge,the Valley of Kings, the Nazca Lines
  of Peru, the heads of Easter Island, even the mysterious vanishing colony of Roanoke. People looked at these things in a much more
  different perspective than they used to.

<h4>Varieties</h4>
<p>Over the period of time in which Archaeology has been developed, there have been different branches created for specific
  parts or for specialized excavations.These sometimes require more special equipment than other excavations so that no
  artifacts are damaged or lost<p>
    <div class="">

    </div>
    <h5>Classical Archaeology</h5>
    <p>As it suggests, this is the most basic out of all the different types of Archaeology. It was the first one to be
      technically used in the 15th and 16th centuries when people were focused on the works of the Ancient Greeks and Romans.
      So it still focuses on those specific topics today and has played a huge part in some of the most famous digs such as
        Agora dig in Athens,Greece and the Pompeii dig, both of which are still being excavated to this day.

      <div class="">

      </div>
      <h5>Historical Archaeology</h5>
        <p>This type of archaeology is not as hands on as the other types. This type involves the reconstruction of historical sites
          by using not only evidence from various excavation sites but also using evidence found typically in historical documents.
          while not resulting in the recovery of physical artifacts, it does result in major discoveries and the revelation
          of previously unknown knowledge making it play an essential role in most major excavations.</p>
          <div class="">

          </div>
          <h5>Underwater Archaeology</h5>
          <p>As clearly said in the name, this branch of archaeology specifically focuses on underwater
            recovery and excavations.This is perhaps the most difficult of all of the branches. this is because
            of the various variables and hazards found in the ocean that are put into play. It not only proves hazardous
            to the divers and archaeologistsnwho are recovering the artifacts but the artifacts themselves as well. Since
            some of these artifacts have been underwater for so long, exposing them to airborne elements can cause them
            deteriorate rapidly. This means that artifacts must be prepped and transported for examination and study with
            special equipment and extreme caution. Another challenge is actually finding an archaeological site. The constantly
            shifting currents can sometimes bury these sites and shipwrecks in the seabed.</p>
